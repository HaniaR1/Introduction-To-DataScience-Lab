- Visualization Libraries: Explore the capabilities of popular libraries such as:
-- Matplotlib.pyplot
-- Seaborn
- Graph Types: Understand how to create and interpret various graph types, including:
* Line plots
* Scatter plots
* Histograms
* Swarm plots
* Boxplots
* Strip plots
* Lmplots
* Pair plots
* Joint plots
# Statistical Distributions and Modeling
_ Kernel Density Distribution: Learn about kernel density estimation and its applications
_ Other Statistical Distributions: Explore other types of statistical distributions and their uses such as normal and uniform distribution.
- Linear Regression: Understand how to model continuous outcomes using linear regression
- Logistic Regression: Learn how to model binary outcomes using logistic regression
# Machine Learning
